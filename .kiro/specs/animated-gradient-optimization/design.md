# Design Document

## Overview

The AnimatedGradient component optimization will eliminate the effect loop by replacing the reactive assignment pattern with direct DOM manipulation. Instead of using `particles = particles` to trigger Svelte's reactivity system every frame, we'll use CSS custom properties and direct style updates to animate particles efficiently.

## Architecture

The optimized solution will use a hybrid approach:
- Maintain the particle data structure for physics calculations
- Use CSS custom properties for smooth animations
- Leverage direct DOM manipulation for performance-critical updates
- Preserve the existing animation loop structure while eliminating reactivity triggers

## Components and Interfaces

### Particle Animation System
- **Particle Data Structure**: Keep the existing `Particle` type with position, velocity, and visual properties
- **Animation Loop**: Maintain the requestAnimationFrame-based animation loop
- **DOM Update Strategy**: Replace reactive assignments with direct style property updates

### CSS Custom Properties Integration
- Use CSS variables for particle positions: `--particle-x` and `--particle-y`
- Leverage CSS transforms for smooth hardware-accelerated animations
- Maintain existing particle styling while optimizing update mechanism

### Mouse Interaction Preservation
- Keep the existing mouse repulsion physics calculations
- Maintain smooth mouse tracking and particle response
- Preserve the interactive experience without performance impact

## Data Models

### Particle Interface (Unchanged)
```typescript
type Particle = {
  id: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  vx: number;
  vy: number;
  size: number;
  opacity: number;
};
```

### DOM Reference Management
- Store references to particle DOM elements
- Use Map or array for efficient element lookup
- Manage element lifecycle with component mount/unmount

## Error Handling

### Animation Frame Management
- Ensure proper cleanup of requestAnimationFrame on component unmount
- Handle cases where DOM elements might not be available
- Graceful degradation if CSS custom properties aren't supported

### Performance Safeguards
- Implement frame rate limiting if needed
- Add checks for element existence before DOM manipulation
- Fallback to existing behavior if optimization fails

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
- Measure frame rates before and after optimization
- Monitor CPU usage during animation
- Test with various numbers of particles

### Functional Testing
- Verify particle animations remain smooth
- Test mouse interaction responsiveness
- Ensure proper cleanup on component unmount

### Browser Compatibility
- Test CSS custom property support
- Verify hardware acceleration works across browsers
- Ensure fallback behavior functions correctly
