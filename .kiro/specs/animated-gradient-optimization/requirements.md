# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a performance issue in the AnimatedGradient component where an effect loop is causing unnecessary re-renders. The component currently uses `particles = particles` inside a requestAnimationFrame loop to trigger Svelte's reactivity, which creates a continuous effect loop that impacts performance. The goal is to optimize the animation system to eliminate the effect loop while maintaining smooth particle animations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the website, I want smooth particle animations without performance degradation, so that the page remains responsive and doesn't consume excessive resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AnimatedGradient component is rendered THEN the particle animation SHALL run smoothly without causing continuous effect loops
2. WHEN particles are animated THEN the DOM SHALL be updated efficiently without triggering unnecessary reactivity cycles
3. WHEN the component is mounted THEN the animation SHALL start without performance issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AnimatedGradient component to use efficient rendering techniques, so that the codebase maintains good performance practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation loop runs THEN it SHALL NOT use `particles = particles` to trigger reactivity
2. WHEN particle positions change THEN the DOM SHALL be updated using direct manipulation or more efficient Svelte patterns
3. WHEN the component unmounts THEN all animation frames SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the particle animation to respond to mouse movement, so that the interactive experience is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mouse moves over the component THEN particles SHALL respond with repulsion effects
2. WHEN mouse coordinates change THEN the animation SHALL update smoothly without performance issues
3. WHEN the mouse leaves the area THEN particles SHALL continue their natural movement patterns
